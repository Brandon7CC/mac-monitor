**At a high level -- can you summarize your request?**
(E.g.) For any given process execute event, pull the entitlements, and display them graphically within the "Event facts" window.

**What is the current alternative solution?**
(E.g.) Use of the `codesign` command line tool.

**Are there "In-the-Wild" threats or corresponding ATT&CK techniques that exist for which this telemetry would be helpful?**
(E.g.) For `T1553.001 Gatekeeper Bypass` -- File Quarantine information at the process and file level is very helpful.

**Anything else?**
Please list anything else that might help us implement the feature you're requesting. This could include marked-up screenshots, telemetry traces, mockups, etc.
